# Fading Lights

This is a Python script that uses the RGBTree library to control a 3D RGB Christmas tree, creating a fading effect on the lights.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have a Raspberry Pi connected to the 3D RGB Christmas tree, and you'll need to have the RGBTree library installed. You can install the library by running the following command in your terminal:

`sudo pip install rgbtree`


Once you have the RGBTree library installed, you can download the `Fading Lights.py` file and run it using Python.

## Usage

To use this script, simply navigate to the directory where the `Fading Lights.py` file is located and run the script using Python. For example, you can run the script by entering the following command in your terminal:

`python Fading Lights.py`


The script will run indefinitely, creating a fading effect on the lights of the Christmas tree.
