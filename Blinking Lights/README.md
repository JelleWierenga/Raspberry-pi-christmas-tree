# RGB Christmas Tree Blinking Lights

This Python script uses the RGBTree library to control the colors of a 3D RGB Christmas tree connected to a Raspberry Pi. The script causes the lights on the tree to blink on and off using the `set_color()` method of the RGBTree object.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have a Raspberry Pi connected to the 3D RGB Christmas tree and have the RGBTree Python library installed. You can install the library by running the following command in your terminal:

`sudo pip install rgbtree`


Once you have the RGBTree library installed, you can download the code in this repository and run the `Blinking Lights.py` script using Python.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it using Python. The script will cause the lights on the tree to blink on and off repeatedly using the `set_color()` method of the RGBTree object. The delay between each blink can be adjusted by changing the value of the `time.sleep()` function calls.
